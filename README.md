# Python Selenium Web Scraping Project: ESG Ratings
This project involves web scraping three websites - Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, and S&P Global - to obtain the ESG ratings of four companies: Denso Corp, Volkswagen, Schaeffler AG, and Continental AG. The purpose of this project is to gather ESG rating data for these companies and analyze their environmental, social, and governance performance.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to automate the process of retrieving ESG ratings from the websites using Python and Selenium. Selenium is a powerful tool for web scraping and automation, allowing us to interact with websites and extract the required data. By utilizing Selenium, we can navigate through the websites, search for the companies, and extract their ESG ratings.


# How the Websites Rank Companies
Sustainalytics: Sustainalytics assesses companies based on their environmental, social, and governance practices. They assign a rating to each company, which represents its overall ESG performance. The rating scale typically ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better ESG performance.

Refinitiv: Refinitiv evaluates companies based on various ESG factors, including environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices. They provide a comprehensive ESG score, which reflects the company's performance in these areas. The score is typically measured on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger ESG practices.

S&P Global: S&P Global assesses companies based on their ESG practices and assigns an ESG score. The score represents the company's performance in managing ESG risks and opportunities. The scale may vary depending on the specific methodology used by S&P Global for ESG scoring.
